# DAO AI Agent Business Card Generator

This project implements a Web3-native AI agent that autonomously generates structured business cards for DAO and protocol agents.

## What does this agent do?

The agent analyzes user input (role, skills, tone) and infers:
- DAO / Web3 positioning
- Appropriate communication tone
- Personality traits aligned with decentralized coordination

It then generates a structured AI agent business card in both UI and JSON formats.

## Why is this an AI Agent?

Instead of directly echoing user input, the agent follows a multi-step pipeline:
1. Web3 context analysis
2. DAO role classification
3. Autonomous tone and personality decision
4. Structured business card generation

This demonstrates agent-style reasoning and decision-making.

## How to run

Simply open `index.html` in a browser.  
No dependencies or API keys required.

## Web3 / DAO Focus

The agent is designed specifically for:
- DAO governance assistants
- DeFi strategy agents
- Protocol research agents

It uses decentralized-native language and reasoning logic aligned with Web3 ecosystems.
